Mrs. Lavender;43;290;At 6pm I was in my room getting ready for dinner with Claire Coral. I called at 6:20 to say I would be a tad late because I had to change because there was a hole in my dress. That's around the time that Bailey Blue knocked on my door. I let Bailey come in and we talked for a little while. He left at 6:45 and said he was going to the bar. I still had dinner plans with Claire, so I left immediately after him. On my way down to the dining room, I passed Mrs. White on the 2nd floor hallway.;Bailey Blue, Claire Coral, Mrs. White;Hallway;Rope, Pistol;[0, 0, 0, 1];115;[0, 0]
Mr. Brown;31;344;I was going to dinner but went to Claire Coral's room beforehand. That was at 6. Then I went to dinner on the veranda with Arthur Amber and his stepmom, Mrs. Peacock. I didn't know Miranda well, but based on what I've heard from Claire, it doesn't seem like her and Mrs. Lavender were too fond of each other.;Claire Coral, Arthur Amber, Mrs. Peacock;1st Floor;Revolver, Wrench;[1, 0, 0, 0];92;[3, 2]

Mindy Mauve;32;519;I took the elevator to my room around 6. I spoke to Bart Bronze during that time. When I got off of the elevator on my floor, I saw Bailey Blue, my brother in-law. I thought he was going to the bar for a drink before dinner at 7. I think I saw him at 6:10. After we spoke, I went to my room to get ready for dinner. I went downstairs at 6:45 for dinner with Bailey and Miranda. Bailey came to dinner at 7 and I knew something was wrong when I realized Miranda wasn't with him.;Bart Bronze, Bailey Blue;6th FLoor Hallway;Knife;[0, 0, 1, 0];114;[0, 2]
Miss Scarlet;67;145;I had made plans for dinner with Professor Plum at 5. Unfortunately I came down with a terrible cold that morning and had to stay in. I was in my room all night. I got room service at 6:15 and ate it in my room. I was so sorry to hear about Miranda. She was one of my good friends from school. Even though we haven't caught up in years, I was so excited to reconnect with her on this trip.;None;Bedroom;Pocketknife;[0, 1, 0, 0];102;[1, 2]
General Violet;69;354;I was on a conference call in my room from 6 to 8, the other callers can vouche for me. In fact, one of them was Colonel Mustard. He was on the call from 7 to 8.;Colonel Mustard;Bedroom;Lead Pipe, Revolver;[0, 0, 0, 0];79;[4, 0]
Claire Coral;24;133;At 6 I was in my room getting ready to eat dinner with Mrs. Lavender. That's when Mr. Brown knocked on my door. We spoke for a few minutes and then he left. I think it was 6:10. I went back to getting ready, and Mrs. Lavender called and said she would be runnning late. Since she said should would be late, I went to the bar around 6:20. I had a couple of drinks with Mr. Green before going to dinner with Mrs. Lavender at promptly 6:40. I didn't know Miranda that well, but from what I've heard from Mrs. Lavender, it doesn't sound like she was that kind, especially to her husband.;Mr. Brown, Mr. Green, Mrs.Lavender;Bar;Dagger;[0, 0, 0, 1];101;[1, 1]
Mrs. Peacock;51;389;I went to dinner at 6:45 with my stepson, Arthur, and our family friend, Mr. Brown. Before that I was getting ready in my room.;None;Bedroom;None;[0, 0, 0, 0];99;[0, 0]

I caught up with Miranda just the other day over drinks, I can't believe something like this happened to her.;Mr. Green, Mr.Brown, Mrs.Peacock;Bar;Revolver;[0, 1, 0, 0];79;[2, 0]
Bart Bronze;53;634;I took the elevator to dinner at 6. When I got off I saw Mindy Mauve. Then I walked to the dining room for dinner with Officer Green and my niece Lily. Dinner started around 6:20 I believe. I have known the Mauve family for years. It's terrible that something like this would happen to such a nice family.;Mindy Mauve, Officer Green, Lily Lime;Dining Room;Candlestick, Dagger;[1, 0, 0, 0];113;[1, 0]

Mrs. White;67;876;I was at the tennis courts with Colonel Mustard until 7, when I went to my room to shower. I saw Mindy Mauve on my way to the room and said hi! I haven't spoken to either Mindy or Miranda in a few years, but I am good friends with their parents.;Colonel Mustard, Mindy Mauve;Tennis Courts;None;[0, 1, 0, 0];92;[2, 2]
Bailey Blue;36;506;At 6:30 I went to visit Mrs. Lavender, who is one of my close friends. We used to date years ago, but my parents did not approve. After that, I moved on and got a job in Chicago. I married Miranda and I love the life that we shared. A few months ago, Mrs. Lavender and her husband, Bill, moved to Chicago for Bill's job, and so naturally she reached out to me. I never thought I would see Mrs. Lavender again, but I am so grateful that we became friends after all this time. When I heard that she would be here this weekend for the conference, I knew I had to say hello. I left my room at 6:10 and went to Mrs. Lavender's room at 6:30. Before I got in the elevator to go to her room, I saw Mindy Mauve, my sister-in-law, and talked with her a while. Then I got on the elevator and saw Bart Bronze. I think it was around 6:15 when I saw him. He looked kind of disheveled. I got off the elevator at floor 2 and went to see Mrs. Lavender before dinner at 7 with my wife and her sister. When I went to dinner, Mindy was already there but Miranda was not. That's when I knew something was wrong.;Mrs. Lavender, Bart Bronze;Elevator;Knife, Pistol;[0, 0, 1, 0];113;[3, 2]
Mr. Green;29;123;I stayed late for the last conference that I wanted to attend. I would say that I left around 6:15. I went to the bar after that and was there until 7. I remember talking to Claire Coral and Arthur Amber.;Claire Coral, Arthur Amber;Bar;Knife, Rope;[0, 0, 0, 0];103;[1, 0]
